# Lehmer_Means
Defines, calculates and plots lehmer means of a series with given parameters

Lehmer means is generalized means of a series with a parameter that is denoted by the letter p.

-While p=0, the result becomes harmonic mean
-While p=0.5, the result becomes geometric mean
-While p=1, the result becomes arithmetic series

In this repository, the Lehmer_Means.py defines the function; Matplotlib.py plots it in a given series, p range, and sensitiviy;
and finally User_Interactivity.py is the commmand line application in which the series and the p value is taken from the user
and propriate warnings are given to user in case of invalid prompts to avoid error.
